# Viz for Days

This is a personal project for practicing my abilities to produce data visualizations using d3.js, seaborn.py, matplotlib.py, Vue.js, and React.js. 

## Goals

The goal is to produce a small visualization or design every day for the next 100 days. My hope is to be able to make all types of visualizations, from basic ones like line graphs, to treemaps, and dendograms, and then to incorporate more advanced functionalities into each like interactivty using libraries like Vue, React, and as basic as jQuery. 

## Rules

I plan on doing this for 6 days a week, giving myself a break on Saturday or Sunday. 

Each visualization should take no more than 2 hours. Code should ideally be commented, and a README should be submitted with each new viz that provides a description of the design being attempted, the data and source used, comments on how difficult or simple the task was, what the challenges were, and where I can further develop the design or visualization. 

All data used in the project should be saved in the data folder.
